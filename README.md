# [High Performant Custom Data Structures](/high-performance-custom-data-structures/)

This project involves developing a high-performance C program for managing a large set of integers. The program efficiently handles various operations such as finding, adding, deleting, and determining the predecessor and successor of integers in a data structure. The program also includes performance metrics and data compression techniques.

# [Number-to-Word Deciphering](/number-to-word-deciphering/)

Create a program that maps numeric sequences to valid words by assigning unique digits to letters using a given dictionary.

# [Word-Guessing Game Manipulation](/word-guessing-game-manipulation/)

Develop a program that manipulates a word-guessing game by dynamically selecting word categories to maximise the computer's advantage over the human player.
